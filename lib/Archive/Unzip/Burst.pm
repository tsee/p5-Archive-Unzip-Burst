=head1 NAME

Archive::Unzip::Burst - Featureless but fast ZIP extraction

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Archive::Unzip::Burst 'unzip';
  unzip("zipfile.zip", "targetdirectory");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a thin XS wrapper around a copy of the well-known
InfoZip library but it does not expose its full functionality.
Instead, it only lets you extract a ZIP archive to some directory,
about as fast as if you were using your system C<unzip> command
itself.

The module comes with its own copy of InfoZip's UnZip 5.52 included.

If you are looking for a full-featured interface to ZIP archives,
you should look at L<Archive::Zip> or the various C<IO::Compress::*>
or C<IO::Uncompress::*> modules instead. Furthermore, this module
is to be considered B<experimental>. It has only been tested on
x86 and x86-64 linux and is known to fail on, for example win32.
Any help in this regard would be much appreciated.

If available, the module uses the L<prefork> pragma to load its
dependencies either on-demand run-time or at compile-time (if in
a forking environment). It does not, however, require the
C<prefork> module to be installed for normal operation.

=head2 EXPORT

None by default. But you may choose to export the C<unzip> function.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 unzip

Takes a file name and a target directory as arguments. Extracts the zip
file to the target directory. Returns the integer status code from the
underlying ZIP library. Presumably, zero means success as with system
calls. The return value may change in future versions.

To my best knowledge, it should be legal to use and distribute this Perl module

But I am not a lawyer.
