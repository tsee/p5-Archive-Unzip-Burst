Archive-Unzip-Burst
===================

This module is a thin XS wrapper around a copy of the well-known
InfoZip library but it does not expose its full functionality.
Instead, it only lets you extract a ZIP archive to some directory,
about as fast as if you were using your system C<unzip> command
itself.

The module comes with its own copy of InfoZip's UnZip 5.52 included.

If you are looking for a full-featured interface to ZIP archives,
you should look at Archive::Zip or the various IO::Compress::*
or IO::Uncompress::* modules instead. Furthermore, this module
is to be considered EXPERIMENTAL. It has only been tested on
x86 and x86-64 linux.

         self-extracting archive; that is permitted without inclusion of this
         license, as long as the normal SFX banner has not been removed from

         altered versions also must not be misrepresented as being Info-ZIP

         releases--including, but not limited to, labeling of the altered
         versions with the names "Info-ZIP" (or any variation thereof, including,
         but not limited to, different capitalizations), "Pocket UnZip," "WiZ"
         or "MacZip" without the explicit permission of Info-ZIP.  Such altered
         versions are further prohibited from misrepresentative use of the
         Zip-Bugs or Info-ZIP e-mail addresses or of the Info-ZIP URL(s).
  
      4. Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names "Info-ZIP," "Zip," "UnZip,"
         "UnZipSFX," "WiZ," "Pocket UnZip," "Pocket Zip," and "MacZip" for its
         own source and binary releases.

To my best knowledge, it should be legal to use and distribute this Perl module
and its enclosed library freely, as well as commercially provided the above
license information is not stripped. Thus, the license of the InfoZip
library should not collide with the license of the compilation.
But I am not a lawyer.
