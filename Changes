        - Mark Dootson supplied a potential fix to make this module work
          on Windows.

0.02_1 Wed Sep 05 17:20 2007
        - Experimental change to Makefile.PL: Add an explicit mention of
          LD_LIBRARY_PATH and the local unzip src directory. Perhaps
          that might fix the failures related to lacking a -lunzip.

0.02   Thu Aug 30 11:20 2007
	- Fixed some packaging problems. (By default, MakeMaker
          removes all Makefiles from MANIFEST. Tsk.)
